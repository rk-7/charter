## Background

I came across the scenario where I needed implementation of D3.js charts with Angular.

There are great articles for D3.js but finding the ones that use the latest D3 version has been really hard.
Moreover, finding a typescript implementation of D3.js charts is rarity.

The purpose of this project is to keep/showcase examples of D3.js and Angular together.

## Charts implemented
